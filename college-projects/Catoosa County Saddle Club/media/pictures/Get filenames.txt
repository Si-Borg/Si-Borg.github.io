Open a terminal window in, or open one and navigate to, the folder that holds the pictures set.
Once you are there, run this command to add the file names and extension of every photo to a text file:

"ls -n > filenames.txt"

Once you have the text file, surround every filename with double quotes and add a comma after the quotation marks to all but the last one. 
Enclose the list of files with square brackets and add a new array item to the pictureSetsArray.js file with the name of the folder that holds that set of pictures as the first item before the filenames in the square brackets.
