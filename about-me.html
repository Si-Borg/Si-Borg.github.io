					<h3>Early Life</h3>
					<p>It all started on a rainy night in Chicago, 1983...</p>
					<p>Not really, I'm from Georgia, and I grew up half an hour from the closest grocery store, and much further from a good internet connection!
					Most of my time was spent with the various birds we raised and playing in the woods.
					I had a GameCube, a Gameboy, a DS, and my brother's old XBox.
					That was about all the interest I had in technology with the dialup internet connection we had.</p>

					<h3>Recent Years</h3>
					<p>
						As I got older, I took more of an interest in playing games on computers, like Heroes of Might and Magic 2, Insaniquarium, and Minecraft.
						Before I knew it, I was building a PC of my own and wanting to learn all about technology!
						I decided to pursue a career in software development, and the ease with which you can create good-looking GUIs with HTML and CSS made web development sound like a great option.
						Once I decided my direction, I started attending Georgia Northwester Technical College and working towards an Associate's in website design and development, which I have since finished!

					<h3>Current Time</h3>
					<p>
						As I mentioned before, I enjoy technology, so I am always seeking to deepen my understanding of the concepts that undergird programming and not just the syntax of a single language.
						I love to learn in a hands-on way, with real world problems. 
						I talk myself through a lot of the problems I encounter and research when I feel like I don't know enough to tackle them yet.
						I enjoy learning from those who have more experience and I can come off as quiet because I like to listen before I speak.
					</p>

					<h3>My Future</h3>
					<p>
						I would like to gain more experience with back-end development, but my end goal is to be a well-rounded full-stack developer. 
						I want to learn more so I can contribute to some of the open source projects that have helped me.
						I know I still have so much more to learn, so I look forward to learning about this ever growing and changing field for the rest of my life!
